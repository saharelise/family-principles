We want everyone to
- get a good night of sleep every night
- spend time outside every day, weather permitting
- spend time with one another every day (e.g. dinner)

Rules
- Complete homework promptly after school, and in advance of deadlines
- Lights-out is at 8:45pm for ages 6 to 12; 10pm (11pm on Fri and Sat)for ages 13 to 14; and 11pm for ages 15-18. 
- No personal devices in bedrooms at night. All devices must be in the upstairs vestibule at least 15 minutes before lights-out
- Maximum of 1 hour of non-school screen time on weekdays after school, only after homework and practice is done
- No screens during meals

Consequence Ladder (and Earning Back)
- **Most issues:** Reminder → Short pause (5–15 min) → Loss of related privilege (same day) → 24‑hr reduction + make amends.
- **Major issues (bullying, safety):** Immediate loss of device/social privileges 24–72h + repair plan.

Examples of making amends
- Write a sincere apology (3-5 sentences) and propose a fix
-  Do a helpful task for the impacted person (e.g., clean their space, take their chore).
- Contribute time to a family project (organize closet, yard work).

Family meetings
- Weekly, Sundays after dinner (30-40 min)
- Topics: review any updates to the rules, discuss issues with the rules and plans for the coming week
