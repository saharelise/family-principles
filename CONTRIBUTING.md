We use pull requests for all changes. Kids and adults welcome.

## How to propose a change
1) From your phone or computer, fork the repo.
2) Edit **Hussain Family Principles.md** to propose specific wording.
3) Commit with a short message like: "Proposal: adjust lights-out for 13–14 year olds".
4) Open a Pull Request (PR). In the description, fill out the checklist.

## What happens next
- A parent reviews as CODEOWNER.
- We may suggest edits or ask questions.
- If we agree, we merge and add the change to the Family Council agenda for announcement.

## Ground rules for proposals
- Be specific: show exact text to change (before → after).
- Keep the tone respectful and solution-focused.
- One focused change per PR whenever possible.
